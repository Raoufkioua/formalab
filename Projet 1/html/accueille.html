    <p id="para">Sunset, also known as sundown, is the daily disappearance of the Sun below the horizon due to Earth's
        rotation. As viewed from the Equator, the equinox Sun sets exactly due west in both spring and fall. As viewed
        from the middle latitudes, the local summer Sun sets to the northwest for the Northern Hemisphere, but to the
        southwest for the Southern Hemisphere.


        Stages of the twilight period

        The time of sunset is defined in astronomy as the moment when the upper limb of the Sun disappears below the
        horizon. Near the horizon, atmospheric refraction causes sunlight rays to be distorted to such an extent that
        geometrically the solar disk is already about one diameter below the horizon when a sunset is observed.

        Sunset is distinct from twilight, which is divided into three stages, the first being civil twilight, which
        begins once the Sun has disappeared below the horizon, and continues until it descends to 6 degrees below the
        horizon; the second phase is nautical twilight, between 6 and 12 degrees below the horizon; and the third is
        astronomical twilight, which is the period when the Sun is between 12 and 18 degrees below the horizon.[1] Dusk
        is at the very end of astronomical twilight, and is the darkest moment of twilight just before night.[2] Night
        occurs when the Sun reaches 18 degrees below the horizon and no longer illuminates the sky.</p>
